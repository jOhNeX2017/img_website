              The EGPT Tests are institutional assessments designed specifically for hands-on practice for major English proficiency exams like IELTS, TOEFL, and TOEIC. They simulate the real structure, timing, and pressure of international exams—so students don’t just study English, they experience the test environment early.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Globally, migration is rising at record levels. According to the United Nations, there are over 280 million international migrants worldwide. India consistently ranks among the top countries of origin, with more than 18 million Indians living abroad—one of the largest diasporas in the world. The message is clear: <span className="font-semibold text-white">global mobility is no longer rare. It’s mainstream.</span> And English proficiency is the gateway.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              EGPT offers this preparation at a fraction of the cost of official exams, while delivering the exact feel of real tests like IELTS and TOEFL. When students grow up taking structured practice tests, they build exam confidence naturally—without last-minute panic or unnecessary coaching expenses.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              It also saves significant money. Alongside test preparation, pre-exam workshops include practical sessions on visa processes, global career pathways, and study-abroad guidance—areas where families often spend heavily on separate consultants.
              Most importantly, this is not just exam prep. English proficiency is a real-life, high-income skill. In a world where opportunities are global, every student should begin building this skill early—not when it’s urgent, but when it’s strategic.
